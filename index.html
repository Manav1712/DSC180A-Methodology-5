## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered this quarter has been the development and application of AI surrogate models to accelerate epidemic simulations. AI surrogate models, which emulate the behavior of complex epidemic simulators like GLEAM, significantly reduce the runtime of simulations, from weeks to days, providing real-time decision-making capabilities during public health crises. This application of AI in disease modeling and prevention is both fascinating and impactful, especially when combined with cloud-based infrastructures for scalability and accessibility.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For my Quarter 2 project, I am interested in investigating how to improve the performance and adaptability of AI surrogate models used in epidemic simulation. Specifically, I want to explore methods for dynamically training and updating these surrogate models by allowing them to interact with real-time simulation data. The aim is to reduce the data storage costs associated with pre-simulated datasets and to create a more flexible and scalable system for epidemic prediction that can adapt to real-world changes in disease dynamics, interventions, and population behaviors.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One potential change I would make to my Quarter 1 project is to integrate an API-driven architecture for model interaction and training. While my current project focuses on building a knowledge graph to predict mental health disorders, the Quarter 2 project will take a similar API-based approach, allowing AI models to query real-time epidemic simulators like GLEAM. This would allow the model to adapt and update its predictions based on the latest simulation data, making the system more dynamic and responsive to evolving disease conditions and policy changes.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In addition to the AI surrogate models and cloud-based architecture used in my Quarter 2 project, I would be interested in exploring the integration of reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making within epidemic simulations. Reinforcement learning could help in dynamically adjusting interventions based on ongoing simulation results, potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of public health strategies. Additionally, I would consider incorporating multi-fidelity modeling, where lower-resolution simulations are used for quick predictions and higher-resolution models are used when more detail is needed, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.
